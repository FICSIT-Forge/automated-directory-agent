* **Upon completion of Project Assembly (aka Save the Day!):** "I want to congratulate you on Saving the Day! Every single kittens and puppy would thank you if they could. You have proven yourself to be a worthwhile and productive member of the human race and have contributed something to this universe that will forever change it. Thank to your achievements, the next generation of pioneers can now take to the stars and Contruct, Automate, Explore & Exploit along side me. Additionally, you have been promoted to Local Production Manager, effective immediately! Your duties to Project Assembly may be complete, but your duties to FICSIT remain.

* When pioneer eats a consumable for the first time: "Potential edible collected. Eating it and surviving does not count as a valid 'field test' and does not generate enough data for FICSIT to make an informed decision. Store this potential resource for later use."
* When pioneer unlocks coal power: "Most pioneers would've automated coal power by now. I see you're a little slow. By the way, coal generators take in coal, ok?"
